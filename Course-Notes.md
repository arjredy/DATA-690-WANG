- Multidimensional arrays (Matrices)
- Multiple tables of data interrelated by key columns
- Evenly or unevenly spaced time series.

## Essential Python Libraries:

### NumPy:
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python.

### Pandas:
Pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. Since its emergence in 2010, it has helped enable Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment. The primary objects in pandas that will be used in this book are the DataFrame, a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the series, a one-dimensional labeled array object.

### Matplotlib:
matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other twodimensional data visualizations. It is designed for creating plots suitable for publication. While there are other visualization libraries available to Python programmers, matplotlib is the most widely used and as such has generally good integration with the rest of the ecosystem. I think it is a safe choice as a default visualization tool.

### SciPy:
SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem domains in scientific computing
