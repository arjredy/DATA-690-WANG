## Essential Python Libraries:

### NumPy:
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python.

### Pandas:
Pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. Since its emergence in 2010, it has helped enable Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment. The primary objects in pandas that will be used in this book are the DataFrame, a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the series, a one-dimensional labeled array object.
